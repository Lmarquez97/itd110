<h1>All of Me </h1>
What would I do without your smart mouth<br>
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out<br>
Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down<br>
What's going on in that beautiful mind<br>
I'm on your magical mystery ride<br>
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me,but I'll be right<br>

My head's under water<br>
But I'm breathing fine<br>
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind<br>

'Cause all of me <br>
Loves all of you<br>
Love your curves and all your edges<br>
All your perfect imperfections<br>
Give your all to me<br>
I'll give my all to you<br>
You're my end and my beginning<br>
Even when I lose I'm winning<br>
'Cause I give you all, all of me
And you give me all, all of you
